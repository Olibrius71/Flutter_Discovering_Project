Flutter project made so as to discover the technology, 

A simple calculator that handles basic operations (adding, substracting, multiply and divide) that also works with decimal numbers and that handles some exceptions (impossible to use as operand for example .45 so no digits before the point and handling of the divide by zero exception), might code other projects in the future
